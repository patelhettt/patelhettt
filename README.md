## 🧑‍🎓 About Me

- 🎓 Student | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Professional Coffee Drinker

- 🧩 Puzzle solver, meme lover, and aspiring CTF (Capture The Flag) champion.

## 🛡️ Top Skills

- **Cybersecurity:**  
  I scan, I hack (legally!), I defend. Think of me as the digital version of a superhero—minus the cape, but with extra firewalls.

- **Problem Solving:**  
  If you give me a puzzle, I’ll solve it. If you give me a bug, I’ll squash it. If you give me a pizza, I’ll eat it.

- **Teamwork & Communication:**  
  I believe collaboration makes the dream work (and also makes debugging way less painful!).

- 💡 “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” is my life’s mantra.
- 🌍 I’m always up for a CTF challenge or a good cybersecurity meme.
- 🚀 Life goal: Build something awesome, break it (for science), then make it unbreakable!
